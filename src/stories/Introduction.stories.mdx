# Getting started

Knack UI Design System is a reusable component library that helps Knack App contributors build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

## **Installation**

KUDS components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df).

Add KUDS to your project.

`npm install --save knack-ui`

### **Usage**

Import all the components you want into your UI.

`import { Button, Stack, Input, Box } from 'knack-ui';`

and use them like so

```
  const Example = () => (
    <Box paper p={4} mx={2}>
      <Stack direction='column' mb={4} gap={3}>
        <Button variant='primary' size='small'>Knack UI button</Button>
        <Button variant='secondary'>Knack UI button 2</Button>
      </Stack>
      <Input variant='large' />
    </Box>
  )
```
