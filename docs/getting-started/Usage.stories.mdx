# **Usage**

---

##### **Knack-ui uses a theme system, allowing different projects to supply their customized values to be interpreted.**

First, start with importing `ThemeProvider` and place it at the root of your project.

```

import { ThemeProvider } from "knack-ui";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";


const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);

root.render(
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
);

```

Now, `ThemeProvider` can accept two different props: `theme` and `mode`, and it depends on if you want to use the built-in theme or create a custom theme.

- **If you wish to use the built-in theme without any modifications, just provide the theme mode. it can be `auto | light | dark`.**

```

import { ThemeProvider } from 'knack-ui';

<ThemeProvider mode='auto'>
  {/* Your application */}
</ThemeProvider>

```

- **If you wish to use a customized theme, you need first to create a theme by importing and calling `createTheme()`. **

`createTheme` accepts two arguments, the first being the mode `light | dark`, and the second being the custom theme object. see `Theme` section for more info.

```
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from 'knack-ui';

const myTheme = createTheme('light', {});

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  {/* Your application */}
</ThemeProvider>

```

## Usage with existing `styled-components` project.

If your project already uses `styled-components`.

Since `knack-ui` already uses `styled-components` in its core, we need to merge `knack-ui`'s theme with your project theme. The reason behind this is we're internally using `useTheme()` which returns it's values from the nearest `ThemeProvider`, It doesn't differenciate between your project's `ThemeProvider` and our `ThemeProvider`. So whoever is closest wins, and obviously you'd want your project's theme to be accessible.

##### Example:

` import` `ThemeProvider` from the project's `styled-components`, and create our theme from knack-ui's `createTheme` function.

```

import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import { createTheme } from 'knack-ui';
import { theme } from "./styles/theme"; // import your project's theme



const projectTheme = useMemo(() => {
  const knackTheme = createTheme("light", { colors: { primary: "hsl(230deg,80%,54%)" } });
  return { ...theme, knackTheme };
}, []);

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <Heading> Hello World! <Heading>
</ThemeProvider>

const Heading = styled.h1`
color:${p => p.theme.knackTheme.colors.primary};
`

```

### Important note for typescript users:

If you have a custom theme make sure to add `knackTheme` key to your theme type. so it acts like a part of your project theme.

```
// "./styles/theme.ts"

import { KnackTheme } from "knack-ui";

export interface ProjectTheme {
   //...your theme values.
}

export const theme: ProjectTheme = {
  //...your theme types.
};
export interface Theme extends ProjectTheme {
  knackTheme: KnackTheme;
}



```
